##Peer evaluation tool

###What are we building?

This is a peer-evaluation tool to allow students involved in VIP programs around the universiry to evaluate their team-members.  This feedback will allow administrators and mentors to find problems in their teams, assess students performance, and monitor growth for returning students.

###Who uses this software?

University VIP director (or their IT staff) must be able to install the program using one html file or one folder and follow a few simple instructions to set up their “server-side” (firebase)

A VIP team mentor (research faculty member) must be able to upload a roster of students from their team (csv, space separated, excel?) and view the results from their team.

A VIP team member must be able to quickly evaluate each of their teammates
